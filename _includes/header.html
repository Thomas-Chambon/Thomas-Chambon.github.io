            <strong>
                I have a PhD in computer science and am currently a post-doc in computer vision.<br>
                During my thesis, I worked on the impact of information transmitted to the user and its influence on the evolution of his behavior.<br>
                I'm interested in computer vision, data analysis and open-source software development. I would like to put these skills at the service of a research team.
